## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- My name is Pedro and i'm currently studying (really happy) software engineering at UTFPR (Federal University of Technology ParanÃ¡), second year.
- I'm currently an intern at [Compass UOL](https://compass.uol/pt/home/) as QA with IA. When i first started the intership i actually had no idea about QAs and it's functions on software developments. Now i understand what QAs do and it's importance (it is reallyÂ² important)
- My career's final goal is to work with mobile development while living in Switzerland, that is why i've started studying german.
